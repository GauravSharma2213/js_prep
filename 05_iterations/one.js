// For loop

// for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {

// Firstly, we took a variable: index. Then we do the condition check with the array lenght property and lastly
// we increace the varibale named index. After that in the block scope we print the array's value

// Line by line working of a loop:(line no.3) You take a varibale: index then do the condition check > directly after that you 
// print that value (line no 4) > Then it goes back and add another value to the variable (line number 3)

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    const element = i;

    }
    // console.log(element);
}
// In this loop the line with starts peinted in the middle because its supposed to go to the last line before going up
// and adding a number to it
